    . Script  to correct the profile  line.
    The purpose of this script is to straighten out the coordinates taken 
    during the data collection. Due to the aleas of the terrain being
    in mountainous or in forest regions, the land harvesting
    is not an exact distance. This script offers several possibilities 
    for recovery: 
        
    1- Classical reajustment {"classic"} in linear regim. Here all the 
    coordinates are straightened in the form
        of a function y = f (dl) : dl = dipole length . 
    2. Natural or distorted recovery {"natural|distored"}. In this type 
    of reajustment the staion, seperation respects 
        the distance  of the dipole, but the poinst do not form a line regime.
        f (dl) = a dl^m+ b dl^s+...+z^0 
       
    3. Equidistant recovery {"equidistant"}. It doesnt based on the computation
    of dipole length, just use derived from distanciation of coordinates, compute 
        the mean between each station and and reajusted cordinates. 
        **Default** is 'classic'
        User can also take advantage at the same time to correct easting
        and northing coordinates using reajust
        arguments (x, y) ; index
